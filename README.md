# 🔁 Day 6 - Even Number Printer with Loop Control

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **Day 6** of my **#30DaysOfPythonChallenge**. Today’s project is all about mastering loops and understanding how to control them precisely using `continue` and `break`.

---

## 📌 What’s This About?
Today’s focus: **Looping & Loop Control in Python** — using `for` loops to iterate over a range and controlling the flow of execution with `continue` and `break`.

---

## 💭 Why Build This?
Loops are essential in any programming language. This project helps build a solid foundation in how Python loops work — especially how to **skip**, **stop**, or **continue** loops based on conditions.

---

## ✨ Features

Here’s what the program does:
- 🔢 Loops through numbers from 1 to 50
- 🟦 Prints only **even** numbers
- ⏭️ Skips the number **20** using `continue`
- 🛑 Stops the loop entirely at **40** using `break`

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stuff

Built with:
- 🐍 **Python 3**
- 🔁 `for` loops and `range()`
- 🪫 `continue` for skipping specific iterations
- 🛑 `break` to exit the loop early

---

## 🚀 Getting It Running

### ✅ What You’ll Need
Just Python 3!  
You can run the program with:
```bash
python Day06Code.py
